# Vanilla PHP exercise
Easiest way to run this project is to:
1. Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or some other similar 3rd party package
2. Open XAMPP, but it's best to run it as administrator
3. Click Config button for the Apache module
4. Select `httpd.conf`
5. Scroll down to `DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/<path_to_project_directory>"` and edit the path. Usually `DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"` is already good enough
6. Do the same for `<Directory "C:/xampp/<path_to_project_directory>">` then save changes
7. Go to your browser then type `localhost/index.php` in the address bar
